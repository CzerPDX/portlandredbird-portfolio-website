# Brooke Redbird Portfolio
This is the source code for Brooke Redbird's (Czerwinski) portfolio website. The website showcases Brooke's work in illustration, graphic design, and web design. It was completed about 2018, however it was recently refactored using OpenAI's GPT-4 as it was built before the author attended and then graduated with a computer science degree.

## Libraries and frameworks used
1. jQuery (v3.1.1)
2. Bootstrap (v3.3.7)
3. Lightbox - A JavaScript library for displaying images and videos in a modal overlay with a user-friendly interface.
4. Font Awesome (v4.2.0) - A popular icon library used for adding scalable vector icons to the website.

## Files
- `header.php`: Contains the head section of the website, including meta tags, stylesheets, and scripts.
- `nav.php`: Contains the navigation menu code.
- `footer.php`: Contains the website's footer code.
- `portfolio-functions.php`: Contains the PHP functions for displaying portfolio items.
- Other PHP files: Contain the code for individual pages of the website.

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Set up a local server environment (e.g., using XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP).
3. Place the project files in the appropriate folder for your server.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to the local server URL (e.g., `http://localhost/your_project_folder/`).

## Refactoring and Assistance
This project was originally developed a few years ago, and its codebase was recently refactored and improved with the assistance of OpenAI's GPT-4 language model. The AI model provided helpful suggestions and guidance to ensure the code is cleaner, more efficient, and adheres to modern best practices.

If you're wondering, I let ChatGPT generate the readme and its own contribution statement as well, because I think it earned it! This refactor is much better!
