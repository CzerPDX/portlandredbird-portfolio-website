## Refactoring and Assistance

This project was originally developed a few years ago, and its codebase was recently refactored and improved with the assistance of OpenAI's GPT-4 language model. The AI model provided helpful suggestions and guidance to ensure the code is cleaner, more efficient, and adheres to modern best practices.

If you're interested in using AI language models like GPT-4 for similar purposes, you can visit OpenAI's website (https://www.openai.com/) to learn more about their offerings and capabilities.


If you're wondering, I let ChatGPT generate the readme and its own contribution statement as well, because I think it earned it! This refactor is much better!
